# Retail-Performance-Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive analysis of transaction data from a UK-based online retail store between 2009 and 2011. It combines data engineering, analytics, and visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales performance.

### Project Objectives :
To analyze transaction data and extract actionable insights for decision-making.

To create a visually engaging dashboard using Power BI for effective storytelling.

To demonstrate the integration of data cleaning, ETL processes, and database management for analytics.

### Dataset 

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains:

541,912 rows of detailed transaction records.

Various product categories, including home decor, gifts, and seasonal items.

Data primarily from the United Kingdom, along with other regions.

### Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For creating an interactive and detailed dashboard.

Python: For performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and cleaning the dataset.

MySQL: For solving key performance indicators (KPIs) and managing the database.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation:

The dataset, originally in Excel format, was transformed using Python scripts.
Some parts of the dataset were cleaned to handle missing or inconsistent data.

### ETL and KPI Analysis:

Python was used for ETL processes to prepare data for analysis.
Key KPIs were calculated using MySQL, ensuring robust database operations.
Dashboard Creation:

A Power BI dashboard was designed with four distinct pages to present insights effectively:

Overview Page: Displays general sales trends and metrics.

Customer Insight: Explores customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

Product Insight: Analyzes the performance of products across categories.

Regional Insight: Compares sales trends across different regions.
Key Insights

Sales Trends: Yearly and monthly sales trends show seasonal spikes in purchasing behavior.

Customer Behavior: High-value customers and their buying patterns are identified.

Product Performance: Bestsellers and underperforming products are highlighted for strategic decisions.

Regional Insights: Sales performance is broken down by regions, showing significant variations.

### Challenges Faced :

Managing a large dataset with over half a million rows.

Cleaning and transforming the dataset for meaningful analysis.

Combining multiple tools (Python, MySQL, and Power BI) seamlessly.
Outcomes

 A comprehensive Power BI dashboard that presents actionable insights in an easy-to-understand format.
Improved understanding of customer and product dynamics in the retail space.
Experience in integrating data engineering and visualization tools for real-world analytics.
